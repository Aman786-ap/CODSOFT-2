# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This project is an implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with an unbeatable AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm (optionally with Alpha-Beta Pruning) to calculate the best possible move at every turn. It is designed to always play optimally, making it impossible for a human to win if the AI plays first or responds perfectly.

## 📖 Extended Description

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how AI can be used in turn-based games using decision-making algorithms. The Minimax algorithm evaluates all possible future game states to choose the optimal move for the AI, assuming the opponent also plays optimally.

Optionally, Alpha-Beta Pruning can be applied to reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree, improving performance without affecting the result.

This project helps you understand:

- Game theory fundamentals
- Decision trees and recursion
- Minimax algorithm
- Alpha-Beta pruning (optional)
- Turn-based game logic in Python

## 🚀 Features

- Two-player mode: Human vs AI
- AI uses the Minimax algorithm
- Option to enable Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Text-based user interface (command-line game)
- Game board displayed after each move
- Detects win, draw, or invalid move

🧠 How the AI Works
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, which is a recursive strategy to choose the best move by simulating all possible future states.

Maximizes its own chance of winning

Minimizes the human player's chance of winning

Searches all possible moves, scores them, and picks the best one

Optionally uses Alpha-Beta Pruning to ignore branches that won't affect the outcome

Basic structure of the algorithm:

def minimax(board, depth, is_maximizing):
    if terminal_state:
        return score

    if is_maximizing:
        best_score = -inf
        for move in possible_moves:
            score = minimax(new_board, depth + 1, False)
            best_score = max(score, best_score)
        return best_score
    else:
        best_score = +inf
        for move in possible_moves:
            score = minimax(new_board, depth + 1, True)
            best_score = min(score, best_score)
        return best_score
🎯 Learning Goals
Understand and implement the Minimax algorithm

Practice using recursion and backtracking

Learn about game trees and optimal strategies

Build turn-based logic for board games

🧩 Future Improvements
Add a GUI using Tkinter or Pygame

Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)

Add multiplayer mode (2 human players)

Optimize performance with Alpha-Beta Pruning

Integrate sound or animation for fun
